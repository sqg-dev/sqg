Choosing the right SQLite driver for Node.js can impact your application's performance. 

We ran performance tests comparing **better-sqlite3**, **node:sqlite**, **libSQL**, and **Turso** across common database operations. Here's what we found.

## The Four SQLite Options for Node.js

### better-sqlite3

This library has been tested in production for years, 
offering excellent performance through a **synchronous API**. The synchronous API makes it very performant 
and easy to use, and is perfect for fast queries.

### node:sqlite

Node.js 22+ includes a **built-in SQLite module** (still experimental). 
It provides zero-dependency SQLite access with a synchronous API similar to better-sqlite3, 
and also an asynchronous API.

→ [Node.js SQlite Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html)

### libSQL

An open-source fork of SQLite created by the Turso team. It provides an **async API** and supports both local database files and remote libSQL/Turso servers.
Fully compatible with the original SQLite (file format, API)


→ [libSQL TypeScript](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts)

### Turso

Turso is a SQLite compatible database written in Rust. Currently still in beta.


→ [Turso for Javascript](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/tree/main/bindings/javascript)

## Benchmark Methodology

We tested all four drivers with identical queries. A simple scenario with a [user and posts table](https://github.com/sqg-dev/sqg/blob/main/examples/typescript-sqlite-benchmark/queries.sql).

- **10,000 users** and **500,000 posts** (50 per user)
- **Optimized pragma settings** (WAL mode, 64MB cache, memory-mapped I/O)
- **Various query patterns**: simple selects, indexed lookups, JOINs, aggregates, inserts, updates

Note: better-sqlite3 and node:sqlite use synchronous APIs, while libSQL and Turso use async/await. 

### SQLite Configuration

All databases used these optimized settings:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;       -- Write-Ahead Logging
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;      -- Balance safety/speed
PRAGMA cache_size = -64000;       -- 64MB cache
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;       -- Temp tables in memory
PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;     -- 256MB memory-mapped I/O
```

## Results

<BenchmarkReport file="benchmark-libsql-turso.html" />

## Key Findings

- **better-sqlite3 is the fastest** for most operations, with node:sqlite second
- **Turso has a surprisingly slow query** for `countPostsByUser` (better-sqlite3 is almost 100x faster here). 
   I did not investigate why this is, it might be that the Turso database like many others (eg Postgresql) needs 
  to scan the full table in order to count the number of rows and has no fast handling for this special case.

## Benchmark Implementation

The benchmark is implemented using [SQG](https://sqg.dev), a SQL to code generator.

One advantage of using a code generator like [SQG](https://sqg.dev) is that you can switch between SQLite drivers without rewriting your queries. SQG generates type-safe code for all four drivers from the same SQL file:

```yaml
# sqg.yaml - generate code for multiple drivers
sql:
  - files:
      - queries.sql
    gen:
      - generator: typescript/sqlite/better-sqlite3
        output: ./src/db-better-sqlite3.ts
      - generator: typescript/sqlite/node
        output: ./src/db-node-sqlite.ts
      - generator: typescript/sqlite/libsql
        output: ./src/db-libsql.ts
      - generator: typescript/sqlite/turso
        output: ./src/db-turso.ts
```

This makes it easy to benchmark with your actual queries and switch drivers by changing imports.

## Try It Yourself

The benchmark code is available in our [examples repository](https://github.com/sqg-dev/sqg/tree/main/examples/typescript-sqlite-benchmark):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqg-dev/sqg
cd sqg/examples/typescript-sqlite-benchmark
pnpm install
pnpm generate
pnpm bench
```

This will generate an HTML report with the results table shown above.



## Conclusion

I think for most applications, [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) remains the best choice.
